Things to make
This is a replacement insert for Audi A6 C7 using regular ash tray. As I found there is no use for the original one at least for me, so I decided to make my own and publish for the community.

This is the first Engineering sample Status that has been published first at motortalk.de Forum.

See https://www.motor-talk.de/forum/halterung-im-aschenbechereinsatz-t5931228.html?highlight&page=3#post53186089

There will be an update during this weekend.
Cheers!
